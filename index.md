### Kaggle ML March Madness 2020 <br>
Sadly the tournament isn't happening, so I'll guess I'll have to wait until next year to see how I did but really enjoyed working on it.
<br>
Some summary data for past years tournaments using the Kaggle Tourney data. <br>

Scrape some stats from TeamRankings.com and KenPom.com.  Added these to to the season games data provided by Kaggle. Credit goes to some past years notebooks using Beautiful Soup. <br>
