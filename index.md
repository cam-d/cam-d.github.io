### Kaggle ML March Madness 2020 <br>
Sadly the tournament isn't happening, so I'll guess I'll have to wait until next year to see how I did.
<br> <br>
I used the data provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-mens-tournament/data) to make this summary dashboard for past years tournaments.

Used BeautifulSoup to get stats from TeamRankings.com and KenPom.com.  Added these to to the season games data provided by Kaggle.
