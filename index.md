### Kaggle ML March Madness 2020 <br>
Sadly the tournament isn't happening, so I'll guess I'll have to wait until next year to see how I did but really enjoyed working on it.
<br> <br>
I used the data provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-mens-tournament/data) to make this summary dashboard for past years tournaments.

Scrape some stats from TeamRankings.com and KenPom.com.  Added these to to the season games data provided by Kaggle. Credit goes to some past years notebooks using Beautiful Soup. <br>
